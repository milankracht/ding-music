      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>DING! is the fresh new quartet led by drummer/percussionist <strong>Kim Weemhoff</strong>, who recently recorded a set of brand-new compositions and will bring them to life on stage this October at De Liefde.</p>
      <p>Kim has played with the likes of Candy Dulfer, Mathilde Santing, Monica Akihary, and the Dick de Graaf Septet. He's been voted Best Jazz & Fusion Drummer four times, won the Slagwerkkrant Readers' Poll, and was the first-ever recipient of the Heineken Crossover Award.</p>
      <p>Guitarist <strong>Milan Kracht</strong> (Egon Kracht & The Troupe, Organic Three) added his touch to the arrangements and harmonic textures. Both Milan and bassist <strong>Jasper de Beer</strong> (Amsterdam Klezmer Band, Spinifex, Naked Ears) also contributed original compositions for the new album, which will be premiered at De Liefde. The line-up is completed by trumpeter <strong>Gijs Levelt</strong> (Gijs Levelt Spoken Quartet, STriCat, Spinifex, Amsterdam Klezmer Band), now part of this close-knit (Weem)hoff circle.</p>
      <p>DING!'s music brims with lively melodic themes, concise solos, group improvisation, and playful rhythms—Afro grooves, odd meters, 70's funk—all with one rule in mind: even when we wander far off the beaten path, we never forget the listener. Sound, swing, and melody remain at the core, just as they have in the most beloved jazz traditions. Think Brubeck, 70's Miles, The Meters, Ornette, Gainsbourg—toss it all into a blender and see what explodes!</p>
